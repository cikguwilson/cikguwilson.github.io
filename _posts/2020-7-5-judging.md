# Correction vs Judging

## Question: Is is true that when we correct others, it implies that we are judging others?

Well, the first “excuse” a pseudo-Christian would most likely appeal to when being corrected by a loving fellow Christian is to misquote the Bible: "Do not judge lest you be judged."

> MATTHEW 18:15-17 (RSV)

> 15 “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. 16 But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. 17 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.

The ABOVE bible passage is a clear indication of the "NEED" to correct. Besides, parents correct their kids; teachers correct their students. Both do not normally have "judgement" as their motive but rather a common loving concern for the betterment of them who are being corrected. Am I implying that ONLY those in authority over us have the RIGHT to correct us? Definitely NOT - observe Matthew 18:15 "If your BROTHER ...". Need I say more?

However, the one who is administering the "ministry of correction" must first and foremost go through the following checklist to ascertain one's motive:
- Am I giving a good example?
- Do I love the person? or Is loving concern my motive?
- Do I have the facts?
- Do I have the right wording to correct?
- Is it God's time for me to approach?

If the above is affirmative, then most likely you have a clear motive. It is likely that you have overcome the following inhibitions before embarking on correcting the "wrong-doer":
- fear of rejection
- misunderstanding "Do not judge lest you be judged."
- awareness of personal sin (We do not need to be PERFECT to correct others, yet we must be AWARE of our TOTAL RELIANCE on God's Grace for a moral life)
- moral indifference

It is imperative that we who correct others MUST HAVE a genuine prayer life that draws Christ near to us, otherwise we risk not paying attention to the plank in our own eye.

> Matthew 7:3-5 (RSV)

> 3 Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? 4 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.
